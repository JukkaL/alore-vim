*** ReadMe for Alore vim syntax ***


Installation
------------

1. Download the syntax file 'alore.vim'.

2. Edit your .vimrc:

  * Add this line to turn on syntax highlighting:

      syntax on

  * Add Alore syntax to .vimrc (replace $PATH with actual path to alore.vim):

      au BufRead,BufNewFile *.alo set filetype=alore
      au! Syntax alore source $PATH/alore.vim


Compatibility
-------------

Tried with vim 7.2.330 in Ubuntu 10.04. Probably works with any reasonably
recent version of vim.

In Ubuntu, you may need to do "apt-get install vim" to install the full
version of vim that includes support for syntax highlighting.
